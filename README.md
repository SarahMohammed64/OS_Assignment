## ðŸ§¾ Project Description

This project is a simple Linux shell **simulator** that mimics basic command-line operations found in Ubuntu/Linux environments. It provides functionality for commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and others, allowing users to interact with a simulated file system in a way that resembles a real terminal session.

The simulator is designed for educational purposes to help users understand how shell commands work without requiring an actual Linux installation. It does **not execute real system-level commands**, but instead reproduces their behavior in a controlled, programmatic environment.
